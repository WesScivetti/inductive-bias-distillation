This directory contains the datasets for the SCaMP minimal pair evaluation as well as the recursion and priming evaluations.

# SCaMP

SCaMP (Selectional Category Minimal Pairs) is a dataset of minimal pairs. It comes in two categories: `plausible` (in which the sentences are reasonably semantically plausible - though note that some have strange meanings due to the templatic nature of the generation) and `implausible` (in which the sentences are semantically implausible by virute of violating selectional category generalizations - e.g., having an inanimate subject for a verb that typically takes an animate subject). These two datasets are found in the directoties `scamp_plausible` and `scamp_implausible`, and they were generated by running `source scamp.sh`.

# Recursion

The recursion evaluation sets are in `recursion/`. They were generated by running `source recursion.sh`.

# Priming

The priming evaluation sets are in `priming/`. They were generated by running `source priming.sh`.
