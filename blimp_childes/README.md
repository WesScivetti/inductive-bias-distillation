The files in this folder were created by running the BLiMP generation pipeline from [https://github.com/alexwarstadt/data_generation/tree/blimp](https://github.com/alexwarstadt/data_generation/tree/blimp) except with the vocabulary (`vocabulary.csv` in that repo) filtered to only include words that appear at least 10 times in our CHILDES training set. If you use this dataset, please cite [https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.25/](the BLiMP paper) by Warstadt et al.
